You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.\n\nJekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:\n\nYEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP\n\nWhere YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.\n\nJekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:\n\ndef print_hi(name)\n  puts \"Hi, #{name}\"\nend\nprint_hi('Tom')\n#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.\n\nCheck out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk.\n\n",
